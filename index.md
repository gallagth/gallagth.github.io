## Experience

### Software Engineer at Keecker, Paris
**Sep. 2013 - now**

Worked on various software parts of the Keecker prototype, an autonomous robot
with a projector running Android and controlled with a smartphone.
By order of importance I work on:

* the autonomous navigation, localization and mapping stacks of the robot,
* the main Android service controlling the robot and linking it with the remotes,
* optimized apps for the robot to demonstrate Keecker's SDK usage,
* customizing the Android OS to run on Keecker's board.

### Research Assistant at the University of New South Wales, Sydney
**Jan. 2010 - Jul. 2013**

System designer for the SIMO (Simplified Information for Mobility and Orientation) project

+ Designed, implemented and tested an indoor positioning platform based on sensor
fusion running fully on Android and partially on iOS.
+ Fundamental research on indoor positioning techniques (Wi-Fi, dead reckoning and
sensor fusion techniques).
+ Designed and ran a survey among Australian Blind and Visually Impaired (BVI) to assess
the needs and wants of this population in an info mobility product.
+ Implementation and test on Android/iOS of the user interface designed for the BVI.
+ Tutoring and undergraduate students supervision in various student projects.

### Intern at the University of New South Wales, Sydney
**Feb. 2009 - Sep. 2009**

+ Development of tools and procedures for Android/iOS to evaluate the performance
 of existing commercial Wi-Fi positioning systems (Ekahau, Skyhook).
+ Research on Wi-Fi/GPS fusion algorithms in urban environments.

## Education

### Ecole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile (ENAC), Toulouse
**Sep. 2006 - Sep. 2009**
