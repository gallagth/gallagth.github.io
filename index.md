## Experience

### Backend Developer at Booking.com, Amsterdam
**Nov. 2017 - Aug. 2019**

As a backend developer in the New Product Development - Attractions team, I was mainly responsible for the following items:

+ Developing new features for the intranet and extranet websites used by internal users and attractions partners to build supply, manage content and access various business performance metrics
+ Developing and shipping a new API for the Android Scanner app used by attractions partners to scan tickets at the entrance of the venues
+ Shipping a new externally facing API for 3rd party providers to manage attractions supply
+ Adding new dashboards and alerts to monitor the state of all our APIs
+ Pushing for CI and provisioning infrastructure to run our unit and integration test suite on each commit

### Software Engineer at Keecker, Paris
**Sep. 2013 - Oct. 2017**

First employee at Keecker, worked on almost all the software parts of the Keecker prototype and production unit, and the services to support it. Keecker is an autonomous robot with a projector running Android and controlled with a smartphone (see [keecker.com](http://www.keecker.com)). Some examples of what I did at Keecker include:

+ Integration of a 3rd party depth camera in the robot, customisation of the library provided by the vendor
+ Design and develop a Keecker SDK for 3rd parties app and integrate it in our Android distribution. Wrote the first version of the developer website: [developer.keecker.com](http://www.developer.keecker.com)
+ Implement a fisheye camera dewarp algorithm on GPU and integrate it in Android's libcamera
+ Develop a WiFi based localizer for the robot
+ Automate the build and test of the robot's software to enable nightly builds and test reports
+ Develop a solution for simulating Keecker, based on the Android emulator and Gazebo
+ Develop an IPC library that uses Android's binder or shared memory to share point clouds or other data between processes without copies
+ Porting ROS and main ROS tools to Android
+ Create a bridge to output all robot's data to ROS topics to enable simple visualization and quick prototyping for control, localization or mapping algorithms
+ Arduino and electronics in the early days to develop the 1st prototype, and to build a simple robotics platform to test new potential sensors for the next iterations

### Research Assistant at the University of New South Wales, Sydney
**Jan. 2010 - Jul. 2013**

Principal fotware engineer for the SIMO (Simplified Information for Mobility and Orientation) project

+ Designed, implemented and tested an indoor positioning platform based on sensor
fusion running fully on Android and partially on iOS.
+ Fundamental research on indoor positioning techniques (Wi-Fi, dead reckoning and
sensor fusion techniques).
+ Designed and ran a survey among Australian Blind and Visually Impaired (BVI) to assess
the needs and wants of this population in an info mobility product.
+ Implementation and test on Android/iOS of the user interface designed for the BVI.
+ Tutoring and undergraduate students supervision in various student projects.

### Intern at the University of New South Wales, Sydney
**Feb. 2009 - Sep. 2009**

+ Development of tools and procedures for Android/iOS to evaluate the performance
 of existing commercial Wi-Fi positioning systems (Ekahau, Skyhook).
+ Research on Wi-Fi/GPS fusion algorithms in urban environments.

## Education

### Ecole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile (ENAC), Toulouse
**Sep. 2006 - Sep. 2009**

+ M.Sc. Eng. in Aeronautical Telecommunications.
+ Coursework in radio navigation, operating systems IT, signal processing and
transmission, networks, radio communications, industrial IT and embedded systems.

### Universit√© Paul Sabatier, Toulouse
**Sep. 2008 - Sep. 2009**

+ M.Sc. Eng. in Signal, Image, Acoustics and Optimisation.
+ Coursework in estimation, optimisation, image processing and classification.

## Projects

+ See Github page for a few software projects: [github.com/gallagth](https://github.com/gallagth)
+ **IPIN 2012**: responsible for the successful bid and organisation of the 3rd International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation, held at UNSW in November 2012.
+ **IGNSS (2011)**: coded a conference guide app for iOS and Android for the delegates of the IGNSS2011 conference.
+ **Multi GNSS software receiver (2008)**: this receiver was developed in C++ by ENAC, I added RAIM functionality and ran a performance assessment.
